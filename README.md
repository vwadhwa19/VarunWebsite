# VarunWebsite
A web application that displays information about me (my personal website) 

I created my personal website using ASP.NET in Microsoft Visual Studio. It contains different features including a timeline, a contact form, web effects, and navigation buttons.
It was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript using bootstrap framework. I published it using Microsoft Azure, and here it is a link to my website: https://varunwadhwa.azurewebsites.net/
